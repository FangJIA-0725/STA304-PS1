      <description>Part I Introduction In this experiment, we focus on analyzing the relationship between two numerical variables. We select two interesting variables from the data we found on the Toronto Open Data Portal. Y is the counts of break and enter in 2016. X is the population of each neighborhood in 2016. We assume a relationship between (counts of break and enter in 2016) and each neighborhoodâ€™s population in 2016.</description>
